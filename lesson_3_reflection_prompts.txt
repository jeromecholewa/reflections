Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: There are several cases:
  1. I need to have a safe place where I keep my files. If I lose my PC or my PC breaks down, I can find my files
  here in the remote repository
  2. If there are several people working on the project, several people can create new branches and work
  independently. Then I can merge the branches whenever necessary. If I worked only locally nobody would be able
  to contribute to my file.
  
Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: not all changes on GitHub are OK before I checked them, if there are several people working on my project
So I need to check the contribution of other people before pulling the changes to my local drive.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: FORKS: it is used only on github (not on the local repository on my computer). It is used to make a copy of someone else's repository so that we can use and modify their files indepently from them.
Still using forks makes it easy to propose your own changes to the original author of the files
CLONES: they are used either on the local computer (to be learned in
another lesson) or to clone a repository from GitHub to my local computer (and hence create a local repository, linked to the remote on GitHub)
BRANCHES: are used in one specific repository (remote or local) in order
to explore some new features of a file (specific code, specific options)
that you are not sure yet to implement in your production file.
