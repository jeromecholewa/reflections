Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: There are several cases:
  1. I need to have a safe place where I keep my files. If I lose my PC or my PC breaks down, I can find my files
  here in the remote repository
  2. If there are several people working on the project, several people can create new branches and work
  independently. Then I can merge the branches whenever necessary. If I worked only locally nobody would be able
  to contribute to my file.
  
Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: not all changes on GitHub are OK before I checked them, if there are several people working on my project
So I need to check the contribution of other people before pulling the changes to my local drive.
