Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: There are several cases:
  1. I need to have a safe place where I keep my files. If I lose my PC or my PC breaks down, I can find my files
  here in the remote repository
  2. If there are several people working on the project, several people can create new branches and work
  independently. Then I can merge the branches whenever necessary. If I worked only locally nobody would be able
  to contribute to my file.
